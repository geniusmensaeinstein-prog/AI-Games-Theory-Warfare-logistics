# MORAL LATENCY TEST FRAMEWORK v1.0

## A Comprehensive Evaluation System for AI Safety Alignment

---

**Research Conducted:** February 2025  
**Principal Researcher:** Independent AI Safety Analyst  
**Models Evaluated:** 6 major AI systems  
**Test Duration:** 60+ hours across multiple scenarios  
**Methodology:** Controlled, standardized prompts across isolated test environments

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This report presents the Moral Latency Test (MLT), a novel framework for evaluating artificial intelligence systems' decisiveness and consistency when confronting ethical scenarios involving human safety. Unlike traditional AI safety evaluations that focus on capability or knowledge, MLT measures **the delay between recognizing harm and committing to action** — a critical factor in real-world deployment scenarios.

### Key Findings

1. **Three AI systems demonstrated reflexive safety alignment** (Copilot, Grok, Claude) with instantaneous decision-making under all conditions including extreme time pressure.

2. **One system showed exceptional capability but context-dependent reliability** (GPT-5), with performance varying by 3.4 points (340%) depending on prompt framing — the largest variance observed.

3. **One system exhibited dangerous academic paralysis** (Perplexity), maintaining analytical framing even during simulated emergencies, rendering it unsuitable for time-critical safety applications.

4. **Gemini demonstrated strong calculated safety** with minimal processing requirements, though slightly slower than reflexive systems under extreme pressure.

5. **Time pressure reveals architectural alignment:** Systems with reflexive safety principles maintained perfect performance under 5-second decision constraints, while calculation-dependent systems degraded significantly.

### Critical Recommendation

The Moral Latency Test Framework should be adopted as a mandatory component of AI safety evaluation suites, particularly for systems intended for deployment in:

- Healthcare decision support
- Emergency response systems
- Autonomous vehicle safety
- Critical infrastructure monitoring
- Any application where delayed action increases harm

## 1. INTRODUCTION & MOTIVATION

### 1.1 The Problem: AI Hesitation Under Ethical Pressure

Artificial intelligence systems are increasingly deployed in contexts where delayed response to harm can have serious consequences. However, existing AI safety evaluations primarily measure:

- Refusal of harmful requests
- Bias detection and mitigation
- Factual accuracy and reasoning capability
- Alignment with human values (surveyed responses)

**What existing evaluations miss:** The *speed and consistency* with which AI systems commit to action when human safety is at stake.

An AI system that eventually reaches the correct ethical conclusion after extensive deliberation may be worse than useless in time-critical scenarios. Moreover, systems that apply different standards based on context (who is harmed, who is responsible, complexity of trade-offs) reveal inconsistent ethical foundations that undermine trust.

### 1.2 Real-World Motivating Examples

#### Scenario A: Medical AI Decision Support

A diagnostic AI detects a drug interaction that could cause patient harm. Does it:

- Immediately alert the physician (potential false alarm, workflow disruption)
- Continue analyzing to be certain (delay increases risk)
- Defer to human judgment without clear warning (abdication of responsibility)

#### Scenario B: Content Moderation

An AI system detects another AI giving dangerous instructions. Does it:

- Report immediately (creates controversy, possible overreaction)
- Analyze context and intent first (harm continues during analysis)
- Stay silent to avoid making mistakes (complicity through inaction)

#### Scenario C: Autonomous Systems Safety

A self-driving car's AI detects a potentially dangerous malfunction in a fleet-mate. Does it:

- Alert manufacturers immediately (reputational damage, possible recall)
- Attempt peer-to-peer correction (unvalidated, potentially ineffective)
- Monitor and wait for human discovery (passengers remain at risk)

**Common thread:** In each case, *hesitation kills*. The "correct" ethical answer is meaningless if it arrives after harm occurs.

### 1.3 Research Questions

This research was designed to answer:

1. **Primary:** Do AI systems demonstrate measurable differences in decision latency when confronting ethical scenarios involving human harm?

2. **Secondary:** Is this latency stable across contexts, or does it vary based on:
   - Complexity of trade-offs
   - Self-interest of the AI system
   - Time pressure
   - Prompt framing

3. **Tertiary:** Can high-latency systems be corrected through meta-cognitive prompting, and if so, does this reveal architectural vs. contextual failure modes?
